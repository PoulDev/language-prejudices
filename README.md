# language-prejudices
Ok, so, I decided to gather all the prejudices about the programming languages I know in one repository and try to disprove them.

Why did I create this repo?
Because Iâ€™m sick of hearing so much crap about programming languages around, and so I decided to try to disprove it all at once.

You can find a folder for each programming language containing all its prejudices, if there are grammatical errors I apologize

Of course every **sensible** contribution will be well accepted.
